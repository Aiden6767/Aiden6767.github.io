<h5>Other Comments</h5>
<p>So far out of all my classes this has been my favorite one and I really enjoy the fact that
    you dont over complicate things. Before school started I looked through the internet
    on how to do coding and stuff like this but it was all so complicated so I just want to
    thank you for helping out in that aspect.
