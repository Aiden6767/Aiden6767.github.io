    <h1>I like to go swimming in the summer.</h1>
    <p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer.
    When the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will find me 
    dipping into my backyard pool. Its no an impressive pool, only
    3 feet deep, but its mine.</p>
    <p>There are three reasons  like to swim:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I get lots of exercise</li>
        <li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
        <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun</li>
    </ul>
